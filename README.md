This app provides a fluid and seamless one-stop-shop for climbers to check out climbs they're interested in sending, or provide reviews (spray) for climbs they've already sent. Climb on!

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ bundle install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rake db:migrate
```

Then run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```

Have fun and send hard!
